Hello To all my wonderous fans!

This is mostly software I will using to help do analysis for TCP connections across various link types as the wonderful packets hop across the network. Useful in my reasearch to find where TCP wins, and also where TCP fails. In the hopes I can suggest something to help make the protocol moer scalable amonst the growing use of wireless networks.
